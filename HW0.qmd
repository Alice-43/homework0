### Define a, b, c and show the equation
$f(x)=ax^2 + bx + c =0$
```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 3
c <- 2
sprintf("The equation is: f(x) = %dx^2+(%dx)+(%d) = 0", a, b, c)
```

### Numeric Result
```{r}
(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/(2*a)
(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/(2*a)
```

If there are two unique results, those two results are the two solutions.
If the two results are same, the number is the only one solution for the problem.
If the answer is "NAN", the equation have 0 solution.

### Plot Result
```{r}
x <- seq(-5, 5, length =300)
plot(x, a*x^2 + b*x + c, type = "l")
abline(h = 0, lty = 2)
```

The intersetions of quadratic line and the dashed straight line are the solutions for the equation.
